#### 1.) Detailed Features:

1. **Color Customization**:
   - **Red, Green, Blue (RGB) Sliders**: Adjust the RGB values to set the exact color for the overlay or crosshair.
   
2. **Size Adjustment**:
   - **Size Slider**: Modify the size of the overlay or crosshair to match the needs of different screen resolutions or user preferences.

3. **Transparency Control**:
   - **Transparency Slider**: Control the opacity of the overlay or crosshair, allowing for either subtle or prominent on-screen elements.

4. **Offset Configuration**:
   - **Offset X and Y Sliders**: Fine-tune the position of the overlay or crosshair on the screen by adjusting its horizontal (X) and vertical (Y) offsets.

5. **Refresh Rate Setting**:
   - **Refresh Rate Slider**: Set how frequently the overlay or crosshair updates on the screen, with adjustable intervals measured in milliseconds.

6. **Custom PNG Overlay**:
   - **Custom PNG Overlay**: Players can load custom crosshairs in transparent or non-transparent .png format. Each loaded .png file is copied to the userdata folder, and a file hash is calculated for each file to prevent duplicate storage.

7. **Glass Overlay**:
   - **Glass Overlay Elements**: Players can cut any region of the primary screen, similar to how the Windows screenshot tool works, to spawn a glass item that mirrors and displays the selected screen area in real-time. Additional options, such as zoom, offset, transparency, etc., can be adjusted. Players can spawn as many glass elements as needed; however, their options are not saved in userdata yet.

8. **Zoom Mode (aka Sniper Mode)**:
   - **Zoom Mode (aka Sniper Mode)**: Hold the right mouse button for more than 2 seconds to activate a sniper zoom overlay in the bottom-right corner of the primary screen. This feature is a tribute to the old Delta Force games. It can be toggled on/off, and the zoom level can be adjusted with a dedicated slider.

I'm a C# beginner and hobbyst, so any feedback would be very appreciated.

The performance of the program will depend on the CPU performance.
